# MINIGIT-DSA
An implementation of a lightweight version of Git that tracks changes to files, supports commits, branching, merging, and log history, without using external version control libraries.

### External Code Used
**SHA-1 Hashing**: This project uses a public domain SHA-1 implementation from(https://github.com/vog/sha1/blob/master/sha1.hpp) to stimulate Git's file tracking logic.
